This repository contains integration libraries for sending metrics and traces to [Kamon APM](https://kamon.io/apm/) from 
JVM applications that are not using [Kamon Telemetry](https://kamon.io/telemetry/). There are tons of applications 
already instrumented with Micrometer and Spring Cloud Sleuth that could use a nice monitoring platform like Kamon APM
and the tools on this repository aim to close the gap between them.

### Spring Boot Starter Installation

The `spring-boot-starter-kamon-apm` dependency brings everything you need for Spring Boot applications:
  - A Micrometer registry that collects high-fidelity metrics and sends them to Kamon
  - A Zipkin reporter that sends traces generated by Spring Cloud Sleuth to Kamon APM
  - A few customizations that ensure the same tag name/value conventions between metrics and traces, so that they can be
    correlated in Kamon APM

#### Gradle Dependency

```groovy
implementation 'io.kamon:spring-boot-starter-kamon-apm:1.0.0-alpha1'
```

#### Maven Dependency
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.kamon</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-kamon-apm</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0-alpha1</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Configuration

There are two required configurations for the integration to work: an application name and your Kamon APM API key. You 
can add them on your `application.properties` file as follows:

```properties
spring.application.name=PetClinic
management.metrics.export.kamon-apm.api-key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
